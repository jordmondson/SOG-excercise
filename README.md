Thank you for the opportunity to take part in the technical excercise.

Please run `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000` to open the application.

Unfortunately, I was called into an unexpected work call soon after starting. My current position allows for flexible hours which I was planning to take advantage of, however the call meant this wasn't possible. The time between the first commit and final commit called 'Initial commit and start timer' and the final commit is longer than 1 hour, however the excercise was still completed within this time.
